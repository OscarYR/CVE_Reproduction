### Summary

Dirty COW is a race condition vulnerability in the Linux kernel's memory management subsystem, specifically in the copy-on-write mechanism. An unprivileged local user can exploit this flaw to gain write access to read-only memory mappings, which can be abused to modify files that should be immutable (e.g., /etc/passwd).

The vulnerability was present in the Linux kernel for over nine years before being publicly disclosed in October 2016. It is called "Dirty COW" because it abuses the Copy-On-Write (COW) optimization and allows "dirty" (unauthorized) modifications.

When successfully exploited, attackers can escalate privileges from a normal user to root without requiring a reboot or kernel module loading.
