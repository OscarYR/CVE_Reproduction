# CVE Reproduce: EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144)

### Details

CVE ID: <br>
**CVE-2017-0144**

Vulnerability Name: <br>
**EternalBlue**

Vulnerable Software: <br>
**Microsoft Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, 10 prior to MS17-010 patch; Windows Server 2003, 2008, 2012, 2016)**

Vulnerability Type: <br>
**Remote Code Execution (via SMBv1 protocol)**

Severity: <br>
**8.8 CVSS v3 (High), 9.3 CVSS v2 (High)**

---

**MS17-010** is a critical security update released by Microsoft in March 2017 to patch multiple vulnerabilities in the SMBv1 protocol used by Windows systems. These vulnerabilities were later revealed to be part of a **powerful exploit toolkit** allegedly developed by the **NSA (National Security Agency)** and leaked by a group known as the **Shadow Brokers** in April 2017. 

Among the leaked exploits were **EternalBlue (CVE-2017-0144)**, as well as its lesser-known but technically related siblings: **EternalRomance**, **EternalSynergy**, and **EternalChampion** — each targeting different logic flaws within SMB to achieve remote code execution or privilege escalation. 

The exploit names were derived from code strings or internal codenames found in the leaked tools. While all are dangerous, EternalBlue became the most infamous due to its role in real-world attacks, as it being deployed in large global malware attack like **WannaCry** and **NotPetya**.

### Summary

EternalBlue is the codename given to a Windows SMBv1 vulnerability disclosed in 2017 as part of the Shadow Brokers leak of NSA tools. The flaw lies in how Microsoft’s SMBv1 protocol improperly handles specially crafted packets, allowing attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code with system-level privileges, also known as **"Windows SMB Remote Code Execution Vulnerability"**.

This exploit was later weaponized by the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware outbreaks, making it one of the most impactful vulnerabilities of all time.

### Example of the Vulnerability

1. The attacker scans a network to find a host with SMBv1 enabled and unpatched.

2. They craft a malicious SMB packet that takes advantage of a buffer overflow in the SMBv1 message handling code.

3. When the vulnerable host processes the packet, it overwrites memory structures, allowing the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code in kernel context.

4. The attacker gains remote system-level access without authentication.
